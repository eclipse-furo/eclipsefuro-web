# Initializing process

To be able to use the components from `furo-data` you have to set up the environment.


### Environment
``` js
// -- initialize application env, api and i18n

import {Init, i18n, Env, Iconset} from "@furo/framework/src/furo.js"

// The services and types must be registered in the Env:
import {Services, Types} from "furo-spec.js"; // this is the file which was generated by `furo genEsModule`.

import {Translations} from "./translations";



Init.registerApiServices(Services);
Init.registerApiTypes(Types);
i18n.registerResBundle(Translations);

```
*Usually this is done in your src/configs/init.js*
