## Framework agnostic

The furo web components are regular web components. Some are based on lit and some are native components.
They work anywhere you use HTML, with any framework or none at all. As a result of following the 
best practices for building web components, our components are [FBP friendly](https://fbp.furo.pro). 

<--->
## API first
The data components are optimized for the furo specs (FIDL). So consuming your APIs is completely transparent. 
It does not matter if you deliver your API as jsons from the file system, as mock data from jsblade, a grpc implementation 
with a transcoder like grpc-gateway, or any other implementation of the specs.
