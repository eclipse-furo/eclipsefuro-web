      <description>Sub Routing #  For applications which just have one view, routing is not needed. As soon you need multiple views, routing is needed.
Even in a small todo app you will quickly have more than one view (list, create, details,&amp;hellip;). Having the possibility to display only one of them at a time, is a nice feature.
 Routing is just the procedure to display a view based on some conditions.</description>
